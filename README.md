# About

Placepicker is about showcasing the breathtaking spots of our planet and it allows you to create a list of places you'd love to visit. üó∫Ô∏è An interesting twist is if you grant access to your current geolocation, the app dynamically sorts list of all available places from the nearest to the farthest destination. üìç
